       <p>"Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
        Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
        Open your eyes , look up to the skies and see
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
        Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
        Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
        ...to me"</p>

        I'm having a ball
        Don't stop me now
        If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
        Don't stop me now ('cause I'm having a good time)
        Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
        I don't want to stop at all"</p>

      <p>"Too much love will kill you
        If you can't make up your mind
        Torn between the lover
        And the love you leave behind
        You're headed for disaster
        'Cause you never read the signs
        Too much love will kill you - every time"</p>
